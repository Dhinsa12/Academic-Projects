As a software developer for small businesses, a lot of the work I produce for my clients is confidential, whether via contract or by my morality. This is a collection of a few economic-related projects I completed as part of my degree so far. 

The first two files describe different methods for solving the following competitive equilibrium defined below using a Shooting Star Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm. The files are not very easy to view on GitHub, but if you download the files, you will be able to run the application for yourself. I promise everything is perfectly safe!

As a bonus, there is a shortest path algorithm, an example of dynamic programming typically used in economics for sequential decision-making, analysis of social networks, etc.
